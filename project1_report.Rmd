## Project requirements

 **GitHub**

I created a GitHub account with the username SWalles. I then created a new repository and called it "[stats220](https://github.com/SWalles/STATS220)". I then created a README.md file in the repository to provide a brief explanation of my plans for the repository. I used markdown syntax to provide a better user experience including:

- Different levels of headers (h1 for the title and h2 for the different sections)
- Ordered bullet points for projects
- Unordered bullet points for project components
- Bold for project names
- Italics for a note at the bottom
- Link to a websites about Markdown syntax
- Link to a website about the Magick R package

*Repo link: https://github.com/SWalles/STATS220*

**R Project Folder**

I created a new R Project called "Project1". Here is the folder for that project.

## My meme

**Insporation Meme**

![](inspo_meme.jpg)

The meme consists of four panes. Two panes contain text and the other two contain an image of a happy man and the last pane contains a distorted image of the same man. I will rotate / shuffle the panes around so they can be read left to right, top to bottom. I will also change the text to something more statistics appropriate and add some images to go with the text. Instead of the images of a man I will use a kitten and use the image_negate() function to create a distorted version. I will also add borders to the frames so that they are nicer to present. 

```{r meme-code, eval=TRUE}
# Frame 1
frm1_words <- image_blank(width = 250, height = 50, color = "#91d2f2") %>% 
  image_annotate("Normal Distribution", gravity = "center", size = 20)

frm1_image <- image_read("https://www.scribbr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/standard-normal-distribution-example.webp") %>% 
  image_scale("250x200")

frm1 <- c(frm1_words, frm1_image) %>% 
  image_append(stack = TRUE) %>% 
  image_extent("250x250", color = "#91d2f2") %>% 
  image_border(color = "black", geometry = "2x2")
  

# Frame 2
frm2_image <- image_read("https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/jw4AAOSwvv1krzzl/s-l1200.webp") %>% 
  image_scale(geometry = "250x250")
frm2 <- frm2_image %>% 
  image_extent("250x250", color = "#91d2f2") %>% 
  image_border(color = "black", geometry = "2x2")


# Frame 3
frm3_words <- frm1_words

frm3_image <- image_read("https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/vEnFyFaX2zK96wVerxokPmEt3dU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Clipboard01-fdb217713438416cadafc48a1e4e5ee4.jpg")  %>% 
  image_scale("250x200")

frm3 <- c(frm3_words, frm3_image) %>% 
  image_append(stack = TRUE) %>% 
  image_extent("250x250", color = "#91d2f2") %>% 
  image_border(color = "black", geometry = "2x2")


# Frame 4
frm4 <- frm2_image %>% 
  image_negate() %>% 
  image_extent("250x250", color = "#91d2f2") %>% 
  image_border(color = "black", geometry = "2x2")


# Assemble meme
meme_p1 <- c(frm1, frm2) %>% 
  image_append()

meme_p2 <- c(frm3, frm4) %>% 
  image_append()

meme <- c(meme_p1, meme_p2) %>% 
  image_append(stack = TRUE)

# View
meme

```


```{r animation-code, eval=FALSE}
# NB This chunk requires the frames from the previous chunk to function
# Animate meme
meme_animation <- c(frm1, frm2, frm3, frm4) %>% 
  image_scale(geometry = "500x500") %>% 
  image_animate(fps = 0.5)
meme_animation
```

As the animated meme won't be displayed in Markdown I will include it here.

## Creativity
  
I feel that my project demonstrates creativity in two main ways:

1. I made an effort to do research into the magic package. This allowed me to use functions like image_extent, image_border and image_negate to make sure that the quality and presentation of the meme I created was satisfactory.

2. I spent a lot of time with the css code to improve the presentation of this document. I analysed the html code using notepad++ to find the correct identifiers I would need to achieve the effect I wanted. I also read up on css to find the properties I needed.

## Learning reflection

I have finished a couple of other statistics courses that have required me to use R Markdown to do assignment so I had some basic markdown knowledge coming into this course. I have however enjoyed learning about markdown as a technology as well as some formal syntax regarding its use. Learning about how to embed links and images using markdown was a real highlight for me. 

I also feel that learning about css was very important as it will allow me to create documents that are less generic and have a unique and exciting presentation. This is important as it could allow for more effective communication of ideas.

I am excited to learn more about R packages. Up to now I have mainly been exposed only to base R. Learning about different packages and their applications, like "magick", would allow me more freedom while using R.
