## Introduction
Kia Ora! This is a repository for my projects for the STATS 220 course from the University of Auckland. This is a course about the use of different data technologies. This repository will collect my progress as I engage with the subject and record my progress as I improve.

## Project content:
1. **Memes-and-Magick**

- R and the [Magick](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) Package
- R Markdown and HTML
3. **Forms and Plots**
- [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/W83LCSFhKMKk4Y937)
- Bar Charts using ggplots
- Dynamic reporting using paste function
3. **Jets and JSON**
- Using APIs
- Working with JSON files
- Data frame manipulation using dplyr
- Inline R code
4. **Matt vs Steve**
- Using APIs
- Creating visualisations
- Telling a story from the data
5. **Cats and Politics**
- Web Scraping 

*Note: Some of the code relies on external sources like websites and APIs. As of 01/07/2025 all code for Projects 1 - 4 are working, but project 5 relies on the structure of website HTML to remain the same which has not been the case. The project HTML files shows what it looked like when it was working.*
