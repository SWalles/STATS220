## Introduction

The YouTube channels I have chosen for this project is: **Stand Up Maths** and **Steve Mould**. The former channel uses humour to get people excited and teach them about maths and the latter channel uses practical or visual demonstrations to effectively explain scientific concepts. Matt (Stand Up Maths)  and Steve (Steve Mould), the creators of these channels are passionate about maths and science education and I enjoy their content because they are good in provoking that same passion and curiosity in their viewers. They also regularly collaborate and therefore I was curious to make the comparison.

Before looking at the data I had some ideas about what I wanted to visualise.

1. Compare number of subscribers / views over time as both channels grew. Could use geom_line to track subscriber growth and geom_area with alpha to track views.

I did not consider that data about subscriber counts would be associated with the channel and not each video and so tracking down subscriber counts at the times each video was published would be too difficult. I tried something similar, but with cumulative duration and cumulative views instead, but this resulted in a mess of lines and areas, so in the end this idea was abandoned.

2. We can also compare the length of videos between the two channels. We could categorise each video as either successful or not. We could use geom_boxplot to create a box_plot for each channel and each category. We could then add another layer to make it more interesting. (maybe geom_jitter)

I decided that it would be more meaningful to make the "regression" sort of plot (plot 2 below) than assigning each video to be either successful or not based on a variable chosen arbitrarily.

In the end I decided to make the following plots:

1. A bar chart that explored some common words used by each creator in their titles. I used geom_col to plot the top 10 most used words and how many times they were used. I that facet wrapped the plot to separate the plot into a plot for each channel. I also removed the legend as that information was available in the label above each plot. I found this plot interesting as it revealed the educational nature of these channels as well as the more personal nature of the creators. For example if you watched Steve's videos you would know he has a liking for the word "weird".

2. I created an area plot of the cumulative amount of content (or sample thereof) on each channel in minutes. I used geom_area for this plot with the alpha parameter to create some transparency and, after asking on ed discussion, the position parameter to stop the values for channel to be shown above the other's values. I moved the legend below the plot to allow the plot to be wider using a theme layer. Later I realised that a bunch of the videos from Steve Mould were shorts (60 seconds or less), while Stand Up Maths had no shorts. But, that is quite interesting in its own right and its effect is clearly visible on the plot.

3. Lastly, I decided to build on the idea that Matt created longer videos and Steve shorter ones, so I investigated the effect the length of a video had on the amount of views it got. I used a scatter plot (geom_point) and overlayed some linear trend lines (geom_smooth with method = "lm" and se = FALSE) so the effect was easily visible.

## Dynamic Data Story

![](data_story.gif)

On a podcast both these creators are a part of they had a discussion about APIs and as a result Steve created his own [API](https://stevemould.com/api) that compared his and Matt's channels. I used this API as well as the jsonlite R package to get a rough, live estimate of the number of subscribers each channel has (visible on the intro slide). I also tried my best to create a theme for this report that combines the colour schemes from both these channels.

## Learning Reflexion

I enjoyed learning more about the ggplot2 package. It allows me to easily visualise data I am working with as well as allowing me the flexibility to change and manipulate virtually every aspect of a plot. This allows me not only to create clear, effective, and beautiful graphics for communication purposes but also to visualise data and get a better understanding of the data I am working with.

I am interested in learning even more about creating graphics. I would also like to learn more about how to get data form online sources such as the YouTube API used in this project as this would allow me greater access to data to make informed choices as well as satiate my curiosity.
