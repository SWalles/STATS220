# I have selected Minister Hon Erica Stanford
# Features I have noticed:
# My first and second article has vastly different *numbers of words*
# Paragraphs seem quite short only one or two sentences per paragraph
# Number of words and *number of paragraphs* are probably correlated.
# These releases also seem quote heavy, we could count the number of quotes
# Releases also all come with a date
